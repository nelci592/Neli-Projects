    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>A cryptocurrency (or crypto currency) is a controversial[1][2] digital asset designed to work as a medium of exchange that uses strong cryptography to secure financial transactions, control the creation of additional units, and verify the transfer of assets.[3][4][5] Cryptocurrency is a kind of digital currency, virtual currency or alternative currency. Cryptocurrencies use decentralized control[6] as opposed to centralized electronic money and central banking systems.[7] The decentralized control of each cryptocurrency works through distributed ledger technology, typically a blockchain, that serves as a public financial transaction database.[8][9]

Bitcoin, first released as open-source software in 2009, is generally considered the first decentralized cryptocurrency.[10] Since then, over 1,800 altcoin (alternative coin) variants of bitcoin have been created.[11][12][13][14]</p>
